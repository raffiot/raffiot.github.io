<h4>Visualisation</h4>
<p>
Welcome to a temporal visualisation of wikipedia. 
In this page you will be able to visualize the user activity across multiple wikipedia subpart.
</p>

<select id="choose_vis">
  <option disabled selected value> -- select a visualisation -- </option>
  <option value="diseases">Diseases</option>
  <option value="science">Science</option>
  <option value="XX_century">XX century</option>

<h4>Data analysis</h4>
<p>
To further explore our datasets, we will try to analyse activity comportements on Wikipedia.
</p>
<h5>Sanfillipo event</h5>
<p>Let's first observe the activity of <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maladie_de_Sanfilippo">Maladie de Sanfilippo</a> in french wikipedia.</p>
<center>
<img src="./images/sanfilippo.png"  width="100%">
</center>
<p>We can see on this temporal analysis that the activity of Sanfilippo wikipedia page is 24 times higher on September 2018 than in average. </br>
The explanation behind this very high sudden activity is that on September 17, a TV film <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_vivras_ma_fille">Tu vivras ma fille</a> was broadcasted by one of the main French TV broadcaster TF1,
and that the main character had this disease. </p>

<h5>1996 in music</h5>
<p>Let's now take a look at english wikipedia page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_in_music">1996 in music</a> where we also observe a peak of activity.</p>
<center>
<img src="./images/1996_in_music.png" width="100%">
</center>
<p style="display: inline-block;">From this activity analysis, we can see the activity of 1996_in_music page on January 2017 is of 5.447.653 views (34 times the average activity),
so the phenomenon is simillar to Sanfilippo disease but here the explication is unknown.</br>
It is the most viewed page (after wikipedia main page and wikipedia search page) in mid January, however doesn't appear on wikipedia trend page for mid february 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Top_25_Report/January_8_to_14,_2017">here</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Top_25_Report/January_15_to_21,_2017">here</a>.</br>
A possible reason why it doesn't appear on the trends is that the top 25 list excludes "articles that have almost no mobile views (5–6% or less) or almost all mobile views (94–95% or more) because they are very likely to be automated views based on our experience and research of the issue."</br>
And when the page had 1.131.599 desktop views on 15 January 2017, it only had 224 views from mobile-web and 44 views from mobile-app.
</p>

<h5>Winter diseases</h5>
<p>We can also observe expectable phenomenon like the augmentation of user views for the pages of diseases that often occure in winter.</br>
 On French Wikipedia with <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angine">Angine</a> (Tonsillitis) and <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhume">Rhume</a> (Common cold).</p>
 <center>
<img src="./images/winter_diseases.png" width="100%">
</center>
<p>However the analysis of same page on English Wikipedia is less relevant</p>
 <center>
<img src="./images/winter_diseases_en.png" width="100%">
</center>
<h5>Chipko movement</h5>
<p>Another event that occured on end of march 2018 is the augmenting number of view on page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipko_movement">Chipko mouvement</a> as the bar chart representing the activity on the page shows it.</p>
<center>
<img src="./images/chipko.png" width="100%">
</center>
<p>Or this is due to the Google doodle on March 26 that was related to the 45th anniversary of Chipko movement.</p>
<h5>Futher exploration</h5>
<p>To further explore, and discover the cause of an unexpected activity, you can use this website <a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#!/Pageviews_data/">https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#!/Pageviews_data/</a> to get the daily activity of a page and see on what day we observed a peak of activity,
and we can also use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Top_25_Report/">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Top_25_Report/</a>, if the page is in top 25 of page and it wasn't a DDos or automated views you will be able to find the causes here.</p>
